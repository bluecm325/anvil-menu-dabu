# Foundry VTT - Anvil Menu

## Install

TODO

## Menu

The basis of this module is to add a context menu to the Foundry anvil logo. This module aims to support additional modules developers as well by using the Hooks class in the same way the rest of Foundry.

Included are two sub-modules for Anvil Menu.

## Modules

### Fullscreen

This sub-module adds the ability to put Foundry VTT into Fullscreen mode. This is option is added to the Anvil Menu.

Additionally, to support the fullscreen mode, this sub-module will rebind the Escape key to the Backquote (\`) key. This key is usually located right below the Escape key.

This is because the browser will use the Escape key to exit fullscreen mode.

### Display Mode

Inspired by [Sly3r86's Display Mode](https://github.com/syl3r86/displaymode) module. This sub-module adds the ability to toggle the visibility of the following on screen elements:

* Navigation
* Controls
* Sidebar
* Players
